            <p class="py-5">The main goal of this project was to show our programming skills in block based code through MIT App Inventor 2 by creating an app based off of the tutorials, then customizing and documenting it. Me and my partner decided to try something different and we used a different tutorial, we created a Lego Boost Robot, which could be controlled by and tablet through our app. The greatest challenge was figuring out how to initiate the Bluetooth Low Energy Connection between the two devices. After weeks of research and testing we were able to find success, and then proceeded to create a car that could be controlled. We each worked on everything together, and the main steps were creating a pleasing User Interface, glitch free, and then making the connection between tablet and robot secure to allow for control.</p>
